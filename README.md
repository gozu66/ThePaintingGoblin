###Gameplay
In the game you will take control of the Goblin's environment, meeting their needs as best you can against a budget. The environment, in turn, will effect the goblins various needs and desires. You will try to create the most creatively stimulating environment you can, to maximize your Goblin's output of paintings.

Selling paintings earns you money, money can be invested back into the environment.

###Code

The game will be written in [Processing](https://processing.org/). A JAVA based language and IDE. The code will have an OOP structure.

There will be three main parts to the code.

1. **The AI Goblin** will be a semi-autonomous agent with a predetermined behavior set. Decision making on the agent will be handled by a system of utilities that are effected externally by the Goblin's environment.
2. **The interface** will handle all player input and player driven logic. 
3. **The game manager** will handle the structure of the game, level order, feedback and file IO.
